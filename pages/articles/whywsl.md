# Why should we use WSL ?
  
\
Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a feature in Windows that allows us to run a Linux distribution directly on a Windows machine, without the need for virtual machines or dual-boot setups.  

As a developer, IT professionals, or DevOps practitioners, there are several reasons why we find WSL beneficial for our workflows since it offers a lot of benefits in terms of file system, compile tools, and usage speed, especially when compared to native Windows environments.

## Reasons to Use WSL

Here are some reasons why we must consider using WSL within our development or IT workflows

### üìÇ File System Performance

   One of the significant advantages of WSL is its integration of a Linux file system on top of the Windows file system.  
   This allows for better file I/O performance, as Linux file systems are generally optimized for the kind of workloads encountered in development and server environments.

   Linux file systems tend to handle a large number of small files and symbolic links more efficiently, which is beneficial for projects with many dependencies or intricate directory structures. Doing a lot of file I/O operations, such as reading and writing files, is faster in WSL compared to native Windows.  

   Are you developing a Node-based solution? You will notice a significant improvement in the time it takes to build and bundle your solution.

### üõ†Ô∏è Compile Tools and Usage Speed

   WSL provides a native Linux environment, allowing us to use Linux-based compile tools directly on our Windows machine. This leads to faster compilation times compared to running these tools in a native Windows environment. The Linux environment in WSL is lightweight and performs well, enabling a smoother development experience, particularly for projects that leverage Linux-centric toolchains.

### üßä Node.js and Frontend Development

   WSL allows us to run Node.js and other frontend development tools natively in a Linux environment. This can help avoid compatibility issues and streamline development workflow.
   Frontend development often involves using command-line tools and building systems that are more native to Linux. WSL facilitates the seamless integration and execution of these tools.  

### ü¶î SharePoint Development  

   SharePoint development often involves a mix of technologies, including .NET and various scripting languages.  
   With WSL, we can leverage the strengths of both Windows and Linux environments, ensuring compatibility and ease of use
   for a broader range of tools and frameworks.

### üêç Python Development

   WSL provides a convenient environment for Python development, offering compatibility with Linux-specific Python libraries and tools.
   With the ability to seamlessly switch between Windows and Linux environments, we can choose the best-suited tools for our Python development tasks.

### üìÉPowerShell and CLI Tools
  
   WSL does not replace PowerShell; instead, it complements it.  
   We can still use PowerShell for Windows-centric tasks, and with WSL, we now have the flexibility to use Linux command-line tools for tasks where they are more suited. This dual-environment capability is valuable for IT professionals and DevOps practitioners who often work with a diverse set of tools and technologies.  

### ‚ôæÔ∏è DevOps and Automation

   WSL is well-suited for DevOps and automation tasks, providing a consistent environment for running scripts and tools across different platforms.
   Whether we are working with configuration management tools, containerization, or CI/CD pipelines, WSL can help streamline our DevOps workflows.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Development  

   WSL is well-suited for cloud development, providing a consistent environment for working with cloud platforms and services.
   Whether we are developing cloud-native applications, managing cloud infrastructure, or working with cloud-based tools, WSL can help ensure a seamless development experience.

### üè´ Machine Learning and Data Science  

   WSL provides a convenient environment for machine learning and data science tasks, offering compatibility with Linux-specific libraries and tools.
   With WSL, we can leverage the strengths of both Windows and Linux environments, ensuring compatibility and ease of use for a broader range of machine learning and data science tools.  

WSL offers a wide range of benefits for developers, IT professionals, and DevOps practitioners, providing a seamless and efficient way to work with Linux-based tools and technologies on Windows. Whether we are developing applications, managing infrastructure, or working with cloud platforms, WSL can help streamline the workflows and ensure a consistent and productive development experience.
