![PnPWsl2 Main Screen](../images/main-screen.jpg)

## Why this module?

I love command line tools, but most of them don't have autocompletion, making us revisit command syntax help over and over again.

I found myself yearning for a more streamlined approach to manage my WSL2 instances effortlessly - from backups and checkpoints to seamlessly injecting new bits into instances.  

Automation became the name of the game to make the whole process a delightful breeze.

Setting up the SharePoint Framework development toolchain is documented ... but it's still a lot of work to do it manually, if you are a consultant in multiple clients, multiple tenants, multiple projects is daunting and it can be messy.

I also lead IT and development teams, and I wanted to make it easier for them to get started with WSL2 and SharePoint Framework development environments ...and PowerShell ...and Azure Devops ...and ...you get the idea.

Plus, I was actually tired of typing the same commands over and over again (call me lazy ðŸ¤  ).

## Usage

Currently I'm using PnP.WSL2 on a daily basis: its ideal for quickly ramping up a new ready-to-go SharePoint Framework development environment, easily install PowerShell Core environment with already installed PnP.PowerShell , easily install all needed cli : pnpm365 , azure,  etc ...

As an extra ... you can even add your own custom scripts\packages to be executed in any WSL2 instance ( that was really why this project started in the first place )

Cool, hum?

## Goals

- Make it easy to manage WSL2 instances.  
- Checkpoints, export/import, copy wsl instances, etc.  
- Automate WSL2 instances deploying and add extra features to them (like adding SharePoint Framework development environments, git configurations, powershell, python core, machine learning envs, bits and other tools\apps inside a linux distribution).
- Central place to store collection of scripts and tools to make it easier in your IT\Dev\DevOps life.

New features and tools will be added periodically, so if you have any suggestions, please let me know! Have fun, and feel free to contribute to this project!

I hope this is helpful !
